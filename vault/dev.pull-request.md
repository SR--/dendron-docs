## Summary

This goes into submitting a pull request

## Process

### Work in Progress
- if your still iterating on your pull request or if your working on feedback but its not ready yet, put your PR into `draft` mode until it is ready

### Commit Style

We follow [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).

This means commits follow the following format

```

```

``` 
enhance(publish): speed up publishing by 500%
```

* To figure out the category for a commit, see [[Assign Category to Task|dendron://dendron.dendron-site/area.product.sop.assign-category-to-task]]
